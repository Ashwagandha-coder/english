Hello!
I was interested in your vacancy for Android software engineer. I believe that Google is the most important IT company especially in the field of android development.
My name is Daniel. I live in Russia in the city of Chelyabinsk. My experience in Android development is a little over 3 years. In development I use the latest technologies and libraries. I write in Kotlin. I use Coroutines as multithreading. For the yuai layer, I smoothly learn and move on to the compous. I always try to find the best solution for every problem. I have knowledge in the field of computer science. Algorithms and data structures. I think I will solve most of your algorithmic problems from litcode.
I'm interested in the android core team. I believe that there I can apply my skills in optimizing technologies for future android applications.
